Shows CMB T, E, B power spectra, along with temperature foregrounds from Dunkley et al 2013, and noise power spectrum.
Computes the noise power spectrum for the CMB lensing quadratic estimators from temperature and polarization from Hu & Okamoto 2002, for any CMB experiment. 

Requires the Monte Carlo library vegas (https://pypi.org/project/vegas/):
pip install vegas

Just clone the repository, then run:
